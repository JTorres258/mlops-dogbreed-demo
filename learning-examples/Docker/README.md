# Introduction to Docker

**Docker** is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications in a consistent manner. It allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable **containers**. These containers run consistently across different environments — from a developer’s laptop to production — without worrying about configuration differences.

With Docker, we can avoid some of the common problems when deploying an application in different machines/devices, such as:
- One or more files are missing.
- Software version mismatch on the target machine.
- Different configuration settings between machines (such as environment variables).

## Key Concepts
- A **container** includes the application code, runtime, libraries, and configuration files needed to run it.  
- Containers share the **host operating system’s kernel**, making them much more efficient and faster to start than virtual machines.  
- **Docker Engine** manages containers, handling their creation, execution, and networking.

## Docker vs. Virtual Machines

| Feature | **Docker (Containers)** | **Virtual Machines (VMs)** |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Share the host OS kernel | Each VM includes a full OS |
| **Size** | Lightweight (MBs) | Heavy (GBs) |
| **Startup Time** | Seconds | Minutes |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | Full hardware-level |
| **Performance** | Near-native speed | More overhead due to hypervisor |
| **Portability** | Highly portable | Less portable between systems |

## Installing Docker

Docker is already included in GitHub Codespace. In case of using a local machine, visit [this link](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). Make sure your computer follow the basic requirements before the installation.
