# MLOps Demo

This is a demo of a simple MLOps project. Here, a CNN will be trained, tested, and deployed with the aim of detecting different dog breeds. For this purpose, TensorFlow, MLFlow, FastAPI, Docker, and GitHub actions will be used. 

## Dataset

The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. There are 20,580 images, out of which 12,000 are used for training and 8580 for testing. Class labels and bounding box annotations are provided for all the 12,000 images.

## Introduction to Docker

**Docker** is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications in a consistent manner. It allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable **containers**. These containers run consistently across different environments — from a developer’s laptop to production — without worrying about configuration differences.

With Docker, we can avoid some of the common problems when deploying an application in different machines/devices, such as:
- One or more files are missing.
- Software version mismatch on the target machine.
- Different configuration settings between machines (such as environment variables).

### Key Concepts
- A **container** includes the application code, runtime, libraries, and configuration files needed to run it.  
- Containers share the **host operating system’s kernel**, making them much more efficient and faster to start than virtual machines.  
- **Docker Engine** manages containers, handling their creation, execution, and networking.

### Docker vs. Virtual Machines

| Feature | **Docker (Containers)** | **Virtual Machines (VMs)** |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Share the host OS kernel | Each VM includes a full OS |
| **Size** | Lightweight (MBs) | Heavy (GBs) |
| **Startup Time** | Seconds | Minutes |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | Full hardware-level |
| **Performance** | Near-native speed | More overhead due to hypervisor |
| **Portability** | Highly portable | Less portable between systems |

### Installing Docker

Docker is already included in GitHub Codespace. In case of using a local machine, visit [this link](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). Make sure your computer follow the basic requirements before the installation.

## Introduction to MLFlow

MLflow is an open-source platform that helps you track, reproduce, and deploy machine learning models.

It has four main components:

- Tracking – record and query experiments (parameters, metrics, artifacts, etc.)

- Projects – package ML code in a reusable format

- Models – manage model versions and serve them

- Registry – store and manage different model versions

The tracking URI tells MLflow where to log and retrieve your experiment data — essentially, where the MLflow Tracking Server is located. It’s how MLflow knows whether to store your experiment metadata: locally (in files on your machine), or remotely (in a central MLflow server or database)
